2008-10-24  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 4.1.2

	* No code changes. Repackaged, all dynopt functions now reside in
	a single directory dynoptim and not in further subdirectories. All
	other directories should be outside this tree so that the files
	and functions therein cannot interfere with others. Thanks to
	B. Roffel (NL) for spotting it.

	* Begin of a new ChangeLog
