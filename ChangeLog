2009-02-24  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 4.1.3

	* problem3 did not print graph with constraint. main program was
	old. now ok.

	* problem7 was not working due to old syntax of process and
	objfun. now ok.

	* examples tested with matlab 2008b, all work, but with slight
	optimum changes (as with any different versions of matlab,
	fmincon, etc). Only problem1b is still with Matlab 2007a, did not
	converge under 2008. Older versions of matlab might have problem
	with line in the main program:
	options = optimset(options,'Algorithm','active-set');
	It can be commented if necessary. 

	* Users's guide - corrected several typos, all results calculated
	with matlab 2008b (except problem1b).

2008-10-24  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 4.1.2

	* No code changes. Repackaged, all dynopt functions now reside in
	a single directory dynoptim and not in further subdirectories. All
	other directories should be outside this tree so that the files
	and functions therein cannot interfere with others. Thanks to
	B. Roffel (NL) for spotting it.

	* Begin of a new ChangeLog
